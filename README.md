# Phaser Sprite Sheet Unpacker
Tool to unpack frames from a Phaser Sprite Sheet

After searching online I could not found a tool to split each frame of a [Phaser](http://phaser.io) sprite sheet created using tools like [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) so I decided to create a simple command line application that does exactly that.


**Usage:**
```
pssu <json path> <png path> <output folder>
``` 

*It requires Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5*
